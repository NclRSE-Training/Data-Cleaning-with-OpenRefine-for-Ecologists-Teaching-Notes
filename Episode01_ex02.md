    Solution
  </summary>
  On the <code>scientificName 2</code> column, click the down arrow and then <code>Edit column</code> > <code>Rename this column</code>. Type “species” into the box that appears. A pop-up will appear that says <code>Another column already named species</code>. This is because there is another column where we’ve recorded the species abbreviation. You can choose another name like <code>speciesName</code> for this column or change the other <code>species</code> column name to <code>speciesAbbreviation</code>.
