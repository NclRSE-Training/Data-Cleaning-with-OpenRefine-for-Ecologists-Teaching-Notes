    Solution
  </summary>
  Only observations that include only numerals (0-9) can be transformed to numbers. If you apply a number transformation to a column that doesnâ€™t meet this criteria, and then click the <code>Undo / Redo</code> tab, you will see a step that starts with <code>Text transform on 0 cells</code>. This means that the data in that column was not transformed.
