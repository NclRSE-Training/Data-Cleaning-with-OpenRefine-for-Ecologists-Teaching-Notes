## Exercise: Sorting by multiple columns

You might like to look for trends in your data by month of collection across years.

1. How do you sort your data by month?
1. How would you do this differently if you were instead trying to see all of your entries in chronological order?

  <ol>
    <li>For the <code>mo</code> column, click on <code>Sort...</code> and then <code>numbers</code>. This will group all entries made in, for example, January, together, regardless of the year that entry was collected.</li>
    <li>For the <code>yr</code> column, click on <code>Sort > Sort... > numbers</code> and select <code>sort by this column alone</code>. This will undo the sorting by month step. Once youâ€™ve sorted by <code>yr</code> you can then apply another sorting step to sort by month within year. To do this for the <code>mo</code> column, click on <code>Sort > numbers</code> but do not select <code>sort by this column alone</code>. To ensure that all entries are shown chronologically, you will need to also sort by days within each month. Click on the <code>dy</code> column then <code>Sort > numbers</code>. Your data should now be in chronological order.</li>
