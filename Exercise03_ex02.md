## Exercise 2: Numeric facet


1. For a column you transformed to numbers, edit one or two cells, replacing the numbers with text (such as `abc`) or blank (no number or text).
1. Use the pulldown menu to apply a numeric facet to the column you edited. The facet will appear in the left panel.
1. Notice that there are several checkboxes in this facet: `Numeric`, `Non-numeric`, `Blank`, and `Error`. Below these are counts of the number of cells in each category. You should see checks for `Non-numeric` and `Blank` if you changed some values.
1. Experiment with checking or unchecking these boxes to select subsets of your data.
