1. Click on the `Scatterplot Matrix` square for `recordID` and `period` to get that as a facet in the left margin.
1. Redo the `Text filter` on `scientificName` to show only entries including the letters `bai`. Notice the change in the scatterplot. It might be easier to see if you click `export plot` to put it on a new browser tab.
